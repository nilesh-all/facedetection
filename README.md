#Face Detection Tool

A face detection application developed using C++ and OpenCV. This tool is designed to accurately detect and count the number of faces in images or video frames. It leverages OpenCV's powerful computer vision algorithms for real-time face detection and analysis.

#Technologies Used:
Programming Language: C++
Library: OpenCV

#Key Features:
*Real-time face detection in images and video streams
*Ability to detect multiple faces within a single frame
*Efficient and accurate detection using pre-trained Haar cascades or deep learning models

#Usage:
To use the tool, ensure you have OpenCV installed and properly configured with your C++ environment. Compile and run the application to begin detecting faces in your provided images or video feeds.
